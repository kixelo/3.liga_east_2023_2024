# 3.liga_east_2023_2024
Scraping football data and then I performed some data filtering, with help of Python, Pandas and ChatGPT.
Some of data I am using to "inject"/ update Wikipedia tables etc...I did it manually previously,but it was really boring... so therefore I simply automated repetitive tasks.

## Web based computing platform that I used for coding part
```
Jupyter Notebook
```

## Build Setup, required to install dependencies
```
pip install pandas
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install pandas
```

## Image of scraped data:
