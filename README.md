# 3.liga_east_2023_2024
Scraping football data and then I performed some data filtering, with help of Python, Pandas and ChatGPT.
Some of data I am using to "inject"/ update Wikipedia tables etc...I did it manually previously,but it was really boring... so therefore I simply automated repetitive tasks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_3._Liga_(Slovakia)

Jupyter Notebook
```

## Build Setup, required to install dependencies
